  "faqA1": "A5-Herbal Supplement is a uniquely formulated ayurvedic medicine for diabetes made from a potent blend of 25+ herbs sourced from India and Malaysia. Unlike generic remedies, A5 works at the root level by rejuvenating the pancreas, restoring insulin sensitivity, and naturally regulating blood sugar without side effects.",

  "faqA2": "Yes. A5-Herbal Supplement is clinically designed to manage and eliminate Type 2 Diabetes within 3 months of consistent use.

  "faqQ3": "How long does it take to see results with A5-Herbal Supplement?",

  "faqQ6": "Can A5-Herbal Supplement be used alongside a regular diet and lifestyle?",
  "faqA6": "Yes. While A5-Herbal Supplement works effectively on its own, combining it with a diabetes-friendly diet and daily exercise enhances the reversal process. A5 – Herbal Supplement supports your body's natural ability to heal, making it a holistic ayurvedic medicine for diabetes.",
  "faqQ7": "Is A5-Herbal Supplement effective for both early-stage and long-term diabetes?",
